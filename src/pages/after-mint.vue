      <p>Since this is only a school project for USC GE A World Music class,
        all the files are minted on the <b><u>rinkeby</u></b> chain, which is a chain for testing and thus will not require any transaction fee from you,
        but this also means that your song will not actually be publicized and be on sell on the blockchain.</p>
      <subtitle class="subTitle">ðŸŽ¶ What to do next?</subtitle>
      <p>
        As mentioned previously, all files are minted on a testing chain. A corresponding NFT market for testing is the testing net of <u><b>OpenSea</b></u>, which is one of the largest NFT markets.
        After you upload your cover image and song, you should be able to see your masterpiece on this open net! Follow the steps below to check out your work!
